			Pih, this looks like a grocery store list.. I don't like it. I'll try more
			personal write up.
			<br />
			At this point of life, it is struggle to make balance between "hobbies"
			and "work", I am sure you, dear reader, felt the same at one point.
			<br />
			First two things from "grocery list" are a must for me. I can live without
			third thing though.
			<br />
			If we're playing basketball I'm taking number 3 because of Allen Iverson.
			<br />
			I am also letting my halfway beard grow because of Dostoyevsky (ok, not,
			maybe, partly, but, yeah..)
			<br />
			Beside those I should mention that I appreciate cinema, Mr. Robot is my
			absolutely favorite piece of it. 12 Angry Man is my favorite classic.
			<br />
			In recent years I started to appreciate so many music genres, lately I
			found Future Funk, it is.. funky.. While I code I am most productive
			having Synthwave running, but sometimes I feel more Hip-Hopish, my Hip Hop
			knowledge is as good as my JS knowledge(hehe) (my favorite is Nas), I'm
			also appreciating 70s and 80s music, rock, pop, dance, jazz.. I also love
			Pink Floyd.
			<br />
			Okay, that's about way too much, I could probably hide my worst stuff here
			and nobody would ever know about it.
