			Pih, this looks like a grocery store list.. I'll try more personal write
			up.
			<br />
			First two things from "grocery list" are a must for me. I can live without
			third thing though.
			<br />
			Beside mentioned, I appreciate cinema, Mr. Robot is my absolutely favorite
			piece of it. 12 Angry Man is my favorite classic film.
			<br />
			In recent years I started appreciating so many music genres i haven't
			quite before, lately I found Future Funk, it is.. funky.. While I code I
			am most productive having Synthwave running, but sometimes I feel more
			Hip-Hopish, my Hip Hop knowledge is as good as my JS knowledge(uh, either
			way around hehe), I'm also appreciating 70s and 80s music, rock, pop,
			dance, jazz...
			<br />
			Okay, that's about way too much, I could probably hide my worst stuff here
			and nobody would ever know about it.
